# Introduction

For the test we are going to ask you to do a couple of smaller JS exercises. The exercises will be very similar (but a little harder) to what you have done in the homework. Note that we do not expect you to be able to answer everything, the questions keep getting harder and will go above what is expected. The goal of the test is to be able to see how far along everyone is in the process to becoming a developer so that we can make the decision if you are ready to start using JavaScript in a project or if you need to practice the fundamentals some more. So try your best to get as far as you can!

## Goal / Requirements

Go through all of the `question-x.js` files. At the top of the file there is an explanation of what you need to do. Read through that carefully and write the javascript needed to solve the problem.

For question 1 to 5 there are some `console.assert` commands to help you check if your solution at least produces the correct results. The assertion will fail if the solution is incorrect and displays it in the console.

Question 6 is a question about tests, make sure you run `npm install` to install the jest and babel packages needed to run the tests. You can type `npm t` or `npm run test` to run your tests in `question-6.test.js`

Once you have completed all of the questions (or it is time to hand in), create a `zip` file containing your answers and send that file to @Rob van Kruijsdijk on slack.

## Grading

Every question has a certain amount of points associated with that question. Spend your time wisely, if you get stuck on a question, move on to the next one.

- Question 1 [up to 2 points]
- Question 2 [up to 2 points]
- Question 3 [up to 3 points]
- Question 4 [up to 3 points]
- Question 5 [up to 4 points]
- Question 6 [up to 2 points]
- Code is nicely organised and clean [up to 4 points]
  - No more `console.log` test lines
  - No commented out code
  - Comments for functions/lines of code that can be unclear for other programmers or yourself in 5 months
  - Are the variables/functions named nicely
  - Check that the code is split logically (no repeated code in multiple functions, functions that are used for the same step close together in a file or in a separate file)

Make sure you spend the time to clean up your code as we will grade on that too!

## Rules during the exam

1. You are allowed to use Google.
2. In case you copy (a line of) code from somewhere else, you must place a reference. Otherwise it is seen as plagiarism.
3. No contact with others during the test.

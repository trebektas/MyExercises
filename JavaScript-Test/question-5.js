 *     plannedDeliveryDate: Date,
 *     isDelivered: boolean,
 *     isReturned: boolean,
 *   }
 * ]
 *
 * The `today` and `tomorrow` parameters are Date objects that need to be checked.
 *
 * As a return we want an object with two properties (`today` and `tomorrow`) that contain arrays of the deliveries for that day.
 * The deliveries should be PENDING (see question-3 how to determine that)! You can copy over the function you created there as well if you want!
 *
 * HINT: you will need to use the Date object and do Date manipulation, have a look at the MDN documentation of that object for functions you can use
 * HINT: the Date object is badly named as it also includes the current time so you will need to find a way to ignore it (see how naming matters!)

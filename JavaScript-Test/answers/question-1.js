 * You are working on the UI of your app, but the backend that will provide your data is not ready yet, so you decide to write some dummy data.

 * You are building a delivery app and want to have an array of deliveries that adheres to the following:
 * - The array should be called `deliveries`
 * - Each item should have a property called `description` which describes what is being delivered
 * - The array needs to have at least 1 item that has the `isDelivered` property set to `true` (to indicate the delivery is completed)
 * - The array needs to have at least 1 item that has the `isDelivered` property set to `false`

# Introduction

For the test we are going to ask you to do a couple of smaller JS exercises. The exercises will be very similar (but a little harder) to what you have done in the homework.

# Goal / Requirements

Go through all of the `question-x.js` files. At the top of the file there is an explanation of what you need to do. Read through that carefully and write the javascript needed to solve the problem.

For question 1 to 5 there are some `console.assert` commands to help you check if your solution at least produces the correct results. The assertion will fail if the solution is incorrect and displays it in the console.

Question 6 is a question about tests, make sure you run `npm install` to install the jest and babel packages needed to run the tests. You can type `npm t` or `npm run test` to run your tests in `question-6.test.js`

Once you have completed all of the questions (or it is time to hand in), create a `zip` file containing your answers and send that file to @Rob van Kruijsdijk on slack.

# Grading

Every question has a certain amount of points associated with that question. Spend your time wisely, if you get stuck on a question, move on to the next one.

- Question 1 [up to 2 points]
- Question 2 [up to 2 points]
- Question 3 [up to 2 points]
- Question 4 [up to 4 points]
- Question 5 [up to 4 points]
- Question 6 [up to 2 points]
- Code is nicely organised and clean [up to 4 points]
  - No more `console.log` test lines
  - No commented out code
  - Comments for functions/lines of code that can be unclear for other programmers or yourself in 5 months
  - Are the variables/functions named nicely
  - Check that the code is split logically (no repeated code in multiple functions, functions that are used for the same step close together in a file or in a separate file)

Make sure you spend the time to clean up your code as we will grade on that too!

# Rules during the exam

1. You are allowed to use Google.
2. In case you copy (a line of) code from somewhere else, you must place a reference. Otherwise it is seen as plagiarism.

# Prep exercise week 4

As a preparation step for the upcoming Q&A, you need to work on the following exercise, which is based on the prep exercise of the previous week.

## Exercise

Last week you updated your database to be normalized. Now that you have some more NoSQL knowledge, convert your database to a document-based database. Think about the following:

- What are the collections?
- What information will you embed in a document and which will you store normalised?

## Discussion (Try to write answers to these questions in text, provide queries and commands when necessary)

- What made you decide when to embed information? What assumptions did you make?
- If you were given MySQL and MongoDB as choices to build the recipe's database at the beginning, which one would you choose and why?

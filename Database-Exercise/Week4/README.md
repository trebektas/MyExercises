# Reading Material Databases Week 4

## Agenda

These are the topics for week 4, all in MongoDB:

- [Embedded vs Normalised data modeling](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/nosql/mongodb/embedded-vs-normalised.md)
- [Advanced MongoDB operations](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/nosql/mongodb/advanced-operations.md)
- [Pagination](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/nosql/mongodb/pagination.md)
- [Indexes in MongoDB](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/nosql/mongodb/indexes.md)
- [Transactions in MongoDB](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/nosql/mongodb/transactions.md)
- [SQL vs NoSQL databases](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/sql-vs-nosql-databases.md)

## Week goals

This week we are going to focus fully on MongoDB as the main example of a document-based database which is the most common subset of NoSQL databases. Let's start with some more advanced data modeling ideas by talking about the difference in [Embedded and Normalised data modeling](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/nosql/mongodb/embedded-vs-normalised.md).

With more complex data models we will also need some more advanced MongoDB operations to work with it, have a look at the [Advanced MongoDB operations](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/nosql/mongodb/advanced-operations.md) section to get to know some of the more commonly used them and then the [Pagination](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/nosql/mongodb/pagination.md) section for a common use case using these functions!

Next it is time to look at some topics that are theoretically the same as in SQL but we want to look at how it works in MongoDB as well. So have a look at [Indexes](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/nosql/mongodb/indexes.md) and [Transactions](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/nosql/mongodb/transactions.md).

Lastly, now that you have an idea of what both SQL and NoSQL means and how they work it is time to answer the question when to use which in the [SQL vs NoSQL](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/databases/sql-vs-nosql-databases.md) section.

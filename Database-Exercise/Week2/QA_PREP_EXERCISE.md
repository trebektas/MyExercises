# Prep exercise week 2

As a preparation step for the upcoming Q&A, you need to work on the following exercise, which is based on the prep exercise of the previous week.

## Exercise

Last week you designed a database for storing food recipes. How can you improve your tables, based on what you learned this week?

- What changes do you need to make to include [these new recipes](recipes.md) in your database?

- Where can you add a primary key?
- Which tables should be linked with a foreign key?
- What type of relationships do you see between the tables?

- Can you make queries to get:
  - All the vegetarian recipes with potatoes
  - All the cakes that do not need baking
  - All the vegan and Japanese recipes

Since your table data might be different from the above questions, feel free to improvise.
Make sure that your database is running locally and that your queries are reproducable in .js files.

Having learned what an ERD is, how would you design one for the database you created? The diagram must visualize:

- Your entities
- Their attributes
- The relationships between the tables

You can use [Lucidchart](lucidchart.com/pages/) or [draw.io](draw.io) for creating your diagrams.

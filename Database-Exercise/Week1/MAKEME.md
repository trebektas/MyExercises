# Homework Databases Week 1

## **Todo list**

1. Practice the concepts
2. Prep exercises
3. MySQL exercises
4. Code along

## 1. **Practice the concepts**

Let's start this week off with some interactive exercises. Check out the following to get started writing your first queries! In the following online course, **do sections 1 (Manipulation) and sections 2 (Queries)**.

- [Codecademy: Learn SQL](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql)

Also make time to do lesson 1-5 from the following:

- [SQLBolt](https://sqlbolt.com/lesson/select_queries_introduction)

## 2. **Prep exercises**

> Prep exercises are exercises that you should work on _before_ the session on Sunday. These are a little more difficult or show an important concept and as such are a great exercise to talk about with your mentor. Have a solution ready by Sunday as you may be asked to show what you did.

The [QA_PREP_EXERCISE.md](./QA_PREP_EXERCISE.md) file explains what needs to be done for the prep exercise this week. There will also be some questions at the bottom to think about. Go through them _before_ the session on Sunday as it will be covered then.

## 3. **MySQL exercises**

> You will need to do some research to solve these exercises. All the concepts necessary to solve
> these exercises are NOT covered in the reading material. This is on purpose.

**Exercise 1: Create and insert queries**

Write a JavaScript file (to be executed with Node.js) that creates and makes a connection to a MySQL database. Do so using the `mysql` package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql).

Remember, It's always better to test your queries as soon as you have created them. Feel free to first write them in any sql viewer tool or mysql console before writing the node program.

1. Create a database called `meetup`
2. Make a connection to your database, using your MySQL `hyfuser` login credentials
3. Create a table called `Invitee` with the following fields (`invitee_no`, `invitee_name` and `invited_by`).
4. Create a table called `Room` with the following fields (`room_no`, `room_name` and `floor_number`)
5. Create a table called `Meeting` with the following fields (`meeting_no, meeting_title, starting_time, ending_time`,`room_no`)
6. Insert 5 rows into each table with relevant fields. Find a way to create the data for those fields
7. Test your code by executing `node <FILE_NAME>` in the terminal. Then check your MySQL database and see if everything has been created as expected. Please, be sure your file can be run more than once. You can drop and create the database every time the file is run.

**Exercise 2 : Select queries on the "world" database**

> For this part of the homework, use the `world.sql` file in the `week1/databases` folder to create the database and tables. Before you go on, execute the file to create a database instance of the `world` database, using mysql console or any tool. Test to see if it's created. Make sure all the tables (`city`, `country` and `countrylanguage`) and the containing data are there.

Write a JavaScript file (to be executed with Node.js) that queries (using select statements) the `world` database. The results given back should answer following questions:
Don't omit to test your queries evey time.

1. What are the names of countries with population greater than 8 million?
2. What are the names of countries that have “land” in their names?
3. What are the names of the cities with population in between 500,000 and 1 million?
4. What's the name of all the countries on the continent ‘Europe’?
5. List all the countries in the descending order of their surface areas.
6. What are the names of all the cities in the Netherlands?
7. What is the population of Rotterdam?
8. What's the top 10 countries by Surface Area?
9. What's the top 10 most populated cities?
10. What is the population number of the world?

After you've written your **tested** queries, test to see if everything work by executing `node <FILE_NAME>`.

## 4. **Code along**

In this week's code along you won't be building a complete app, but get familiar with using MySQL together with Node.js.
